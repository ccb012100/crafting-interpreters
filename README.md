# crafting-interpreters

Working through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

Instead of jlox (lox in Java), I'm translating the code to cslox (lox in C#).

For feature commits, the subject follows the format:

`<Chapter/Section number> <Chapter/Section name> [EC] (description)`

`EC` [(E)xtra (C)redit] denotes extra features that aren't part of the core `Lox` feature set.
